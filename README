NAME
    CGI::Emulate::PSGI - PSGI adapter for CGI

SYNOPSIS
        my $app = CGI::Emulate::PSGI->handler(sub {
            # Existent CGI code, or just:
            do "script.cgi";
        });

  DESCRIPTION
    This module allows an application designed for the CGI environment to
    run in a PSGI environment, and thus on any of the backends that PSGI
    supports.

    It works by translating the environment provided by the PSGI
    specification to one expected by the CGI specification. Likewise, it
    captures output as it would be prepared for the CGI standard, and
    translates it to the format expected for the PSGI standard.

CGI.pm
    If your application uses CGI, be sure to cleanup the global variables in
    the handler loop yourself, so:

        my $app = CGI::Emulate::PSGI->handler(sub {
            do "script-that-uses-cgi-pm.cgi";
            CGI::initialize_globals() if defined &CGI::initialize_globals;
        });

    Otherwise previous request variables will be reused in the new requests.

    Alternatively, you can install and use CGI::PSGI from CPAN, but that
    would require you to slightly change your code from:

      my $q = CGI->new;
      # ...
      print $q->header, $output;

    into:

      use CGI::PSGI;

      my $app = sub {
          my $env = shift;
          my $q = CGI::PSGI->new($env);
          # ...
          return [ $q->psgi_header, [ $output ] ];
      };

    See CGI::PSGI for details.
